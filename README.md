# Tin.ai open-tokens
A standardised repository of unique token ids for training LLMs

## What is it?
This repository will contain an open source version of Tin's token => id pairs, plus additional metadata that aids the creation of composable LLMs. When LLM models use the same token ids, it is possible to cross train, standardize, and refuse tokens that can be considered AI slop and training poisoning.

## Formats
The repository will include compressed formats in SQLite, Json, CSV, and Parquet formats.
